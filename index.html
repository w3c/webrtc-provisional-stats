    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains unofficial additions to the Identifiers for
      WebRTC's Statistics API specification [[WEBRTC-STATS]]. If a metric gains
      consensus it should be moved to the official spec.

      {{RTCStats}} and dictionaries that are extended in this document are
      defined in [[WEBRTC-STATS]]. The term <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is defined in
      [[WEBRTC]] and {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} is defined in [[HR-TIME]].
